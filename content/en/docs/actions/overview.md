# Action Types Reference

FlexiRule provides a variety of action types, each represented as a node in the visual builder. These actions define the building blocks of your business logic.

## Control Flow Actions

| Action           | Purpose                                                        | Branches                 |
| :--------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------- |
| **Entry Action** | The starting point of every rule. Holds trigger configuration. | `Next`                   |
| **Condition**    | Evaluates a Python expression to branch logic.                 | `True`, `False`          |
| **Switch**       | Evaluates an expression and branches to multiple cases.        | `Cases`, `Default`       |
| **Loop**         | Iterates over a collection (e.g., child table).                | `For Each`, `After Last` |
| **Wait**         | Pauses execution for a specified duration.                     | `Next`                   |
| **Sub-Rule**     | Calls another rule as a subroutine.                            | `Next`                   |

## Data & Logic Actions

| Action              | Purpose                                                | Branches |
| :------------------ | :----------------------------------------------------- | :------- |
| **Assignment**      | Performs batch state mutations (replaces Set Value).   | `Next`   |
| **Process**         | Executes reusable business logic from Process DocType. | `Next`   |
| **Query Records**   | Retrieves data from the database.                      | `Next`   |
| **Document Action** | Performs CRUD operations on records.                   | `Next`   |

### **Process**

Executes reusable business logic defined in a `Process` DocType. This is the primary way to extend FlexiRule with custom Python code.

-   **Inputs**: Defined by the Operation's `config_schema`.
-   **Outputs**: Defined by the Operation's `output_schema`.
-   **Mutation Logic**: Processes are designed to be side-effect free. They return results (data) or explicit **Mutation Intents**. The Rule Engine is responsible for applying these changes (e.g., updating a document field or context variable) based on the **Mutation Mode** selected by the rule designer.

### **Assignment**

Updates a document field or a context variable using a suite of operators. This action replaces the legacy **Set Value** action.

-   **Batching**: Allows multiple assignments in a single node.
-   **Operators**: Supports `Set`, `Clear`, `Increment`, `Decrement`, `Append`, `Merge`, and `Toggle`.
-   **Validation**: Strict path protection and event-based mutation blocking.

### **Query Records**

Retrieves data from the database.

-   **Operations**: `Query List`, `Query Doc`, `Exist Record`, `Count`, `Sum`, `Average`, `Min`, `Max`, `Group By`.
-   **Filters**: Visual filter builder with support for dynamic variable values.

### **Document Action**

Standard CRUD and social operations on DocTypes.

-   **Operations**: `Create New`, `Update Existing`, `Delete Record`, `Create ToDo`, `Add Comment`.
-   **Mappings**: Direct mapping of data to fields.

## Utility & Notification Actions

### **Notify**

Communicates with the user or external systems.

-   **Channels**: `Toast`, `System Notification`, `Email`, `External Provider`.
-   **Dynamic Content**: Uses Jinja templates for subjects and messages.

### **Stop**

The final node of a path.

-   **Success**: Ends execution and marks the path as successful.
-   **Error**: Aborts the current operation and raises a custom error message to the user.

### **Raise Error**

Immediately terminates the rule by throwing a Python exception. Used for strict validation where the process should not continue under any circumstances.

## Technical Details

### **Action Contracts**

Every action type is governed by a **Contract** defined in `flexirule/ruleflow/core/contracts.py`. This contract specifies:

-   Required configuration fields.
-   Available outgoing handles (True/False/Default).
-   Allowed **Mutation Modes** (e.g., whether it can update the document).
-   Expected **Return Types**.

### **Action Handlers**

The actual execution logic for each action type is implemented in a corresponding `ActionHandler` in `flexirule/ruleflow/core/action_handlers/`.
